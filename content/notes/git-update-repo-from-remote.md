The most common use case for this would be to sync a forked GitHub repo with the repo you forked it from. It is also the same process you would use in a non-Github workflow to keep your repo up-to-date with all the changes in a remote.

The example below assumes that you, want to:

- Name the remote "upstream"
- Want to update your main branch to match the remote's main branch

```bash
# Add the remote, call it "upstream":

git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git

# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
# such as upstream/main:

git fetch upstream

# Make sure that you're on your main branch:

git checkout main

# Rewrite your main branch so that any commits of yours that
# aren't already in upstream/main are replayed on top of that
# other branch:

git rebase upstream/main
```
